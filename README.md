# Sorting algorithms visualizer.

Sorting algortihms awesome!!!

- In this app you can visualize some of the most popular sorting algortihms in real-time or choose two of them and compare them!
- The project is deployed in [here](https://diegozaratefer.github.io/Sorting-Algorithms-Visualizer/).

I hope you learn a lot using the app!

Have fun comparing different algortihms!

The app has two modes:

## One algorithm mode.
In this mode you can visualize a single sorting algorithm in real time!!

## Two algorithms mode.
In this mode you can choose two algorithms and visualize them side by side while they are sorting the same input.
